## CVIPS: Connected Vision for Increased Pedestrian Safety


![CVIPS](figs/Scenario1.png)

Existing research in intersection traffic safety predominantly focuses on detecting, localizing, and tracking vehicles and other road users, particularly in favorable conditions. However, this emphasis often leads to difficulties in identifying vulnerable road users (VRUs) in various situations. VRUs encompass a diverse group of individuals, such as pedestrians with disabilities, individuals in wheelchairs, scooter riders, bicyclists, skateboard riders, parents pushing strollers, kids, groups of pedestrians, people carrying umbrellas, wearing masks or dressing for winter or rain, and individuals carrying objects. Addressing the detection of VRUs in challenging conditions is crucial for enhancing overall road safety. These challenging conditions include low-light environments, sun glare, adverse weather, or instances where the pedestrians' visibility is obstructed due to occlusions. 

### Proposed Approach

Our approach tackles the detection and trajectory prediction challenges of VRUs in both standard and edge-case scenarios. We propose implementing a cooperative perception system that involves sharing and fusing multi-view camera data from multiple agents to achieve precise and reliable results.
